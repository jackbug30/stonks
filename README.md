## Goals
The point of this silly thing is to measure value of various memes. Instead of measuring times a meme is mentioned or sent through social media, for instance, it uses a market to determine value. If value was calculated through the former method, how people feel about the meme could be innacurate. For instance, the 2018 YouTube Rewind was very unpopular, although it was mentioned lots on Reddit and got a lot of views. The first method probably would have determined it to be popular. In a market though, it would probably have a very low price, because people rate it. So why not just have people rate memes? Because that's no fun. Buying and selling 'stocks', though, is much more fun.
