# New York Stonk Exchange
This is the repo for support files for the NYSE, mainly logos and design stuff. All primary files are stored on 000webhost.

## Goals
The point of this silly thing is to measure value of various memes. Instead of measuring times a meme is mentioned or sent through social media, for instance, it uses a market to determine value. If value was calculated through the former method, how people feel about the meme could be innacurate. For instance, the 2018 YouTube Rewind was very unpopular, although it was mentioned lots on Reddit and got a lot of views. The first method probably would have determined it to be popular. In a market though, it would probably have a very low price, because people rate it. So why not just have people rate memes? Because that's no fun. Buying and selling 'stocks', though, is much more fun.

### Instructions
#### Basics of stonks
Stonks are virtual 'shares' in a meme. Whenever a new meme is added to the site, it starts with 1,000 stonks. People can then buy these stonks from each other. Because there is a limited amount in circulation, economic scarity is created. Thus, an economy is formed.
##### Differences between stonks and real stocks
Stonks differ slightly. Mainly, they're way simpler. Owning real stocks gives the owner voting power in the company and they may be able to earn dividends (get paid part of the company's revenue). None of this applies to stonks.

Now, let's talk about a stonk's life in the NYSE.
#### 1. Adding a new meme
When a new meme becomes a trend, people will want to be able to buy and sell it. First, it must be added to the system. Anyone can do this. Just add the meme's name, choose a symbol, and an example thumbnail. The first person to add a new meme gets 10 stonks of that meme for free, as an incentive to add new memes.
1. What memes can be added? First, we don't mean specific memes, but more general. For example, consider the Spongebob 'ight, imma head out' meme. That's a general format for a meme and is a great canidate for the NYSE. Very specific variations, though, are not good for this site because they're just too specifc.
2. A symbol is a short name for a meme, used because it's concise. You can choose a symbol, but some guidelines are to be as short as possible while still being descriptive enough. Back to the Spongebob example- SPONGEBOB is too vague, but IMMA HEAD OUT is perfect. It's short, concise, but is unique to that specific meme. Also note, they are automatically all uppercase to let people know it's a symbol, not a meme title.
#### 2. Buying a stonk
You see an up and coming meme that you think is going to be really popular, so you want to buy some stonks while they're cheap. Search for the meme and find its page. Then, just click the blue 'Buy' button. Enter the amount of stonks you'd like to purchase and at what price. This is how the system works; you are buying from other people who are willing to sell, not from some static computer. Name a price that you think is fair-if no one sells any to you after a day or two, your price was probably too low, or you are trying to buy too many. Remember that other people have stonks, so if 1,000 people each own one stonk, no one call sell you 5. You can navigate back to your personal buy/sell page to edit the number of stonks to a lower number and/or raise the price. If someone sells you the stonks, you will see your bank account go down and you now own some stonks!
#### 3. Selling a stonk
Log into your buy/sell page. If you own a stonk and someone somewhere is wanting to buy them, you'll see it on your sell page. If you like the price, click 'Sell'. You will be credited that much money to your bank account. If you don't like the price, click 'Decline' or ignore it.
